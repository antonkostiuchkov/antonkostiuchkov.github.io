  h1 About me

  p I’m a generalist and technological do-it-yourself’er,  who is dedicated to learning and excellence. Passionate about web development, web design, and user experience. My interests outside of web development have taken me far afield, including long dalliances into filmmaking and teaching. At the beginning of 2015 I challenged myself and fulfilled my dream to travel both Americas. During my free time, I like to drink caffeine and get back to work.
